# Rareskills https://www.rareskills.io

These are my solutions to the assignments at Rareskills. This bootcamp has the value proposition "Get personal coaching for four months from blockchain industry experts, then get recruited to top web3 companies". I applied, because it is one of the few bootcamps out there. I passed the coding test and Jeffrey Scholz and his team convinced me with their knowldege and industry expertise - so I joined the October cohort 2022. I am happy to be part of the bootcamp. 


--- Week one: ERC 20 ---

I created ERC 20 Token contracts with OpenZeppelin, worked on user management, and finally on a linear bonding curve for setting a price for buying and selling a token. I got to know the Remix Dev Environemnt, all browser based. At the end of the week I added test case to debug. A very cool feature is Solidity debugging, which helped me a lot. 
worked with Remix and Solidity testing. 

--- Week two: ERC 721 ---
This week I had to create first a some images, that I placed to the ipfs. From there I created my first NFT ERC721 contract and deployed my nfts, now visible on polygon (https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x7093CFC26ea2C1a41165e1C9D88173603375027F). I named them Prime Cats ;-). Of course I know the NFT boom is already over, but still a cool thing! Important to verify the contract on polygon. The second task was the most challenging one, a staking contract for NFTs and rewarding the user with 10 tokens every 24h. Not sure how I did this, we will see. A contract gets fast complex and with remix alone it is hard to debug and ensure quality. I assume that's why the next week we go into testing and other tools than remix. Great ;-).
