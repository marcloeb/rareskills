These are my solutions to the assignments at Rareskills. This bootcamp has the value proposition "Get personal coaching for four months from blockchain industry experts, then get recruited to top web3 companies". I applied, because it is one of the few bootcamps out there. I passed the coding test and Jeffrey Scholz and his team convinced me with their knowldege and industry expertise - so I joined the October cohort 2022. I am glad to be part of the team. 


--- Week one: ERC 20 ---

I created ERC 20 Token contracts with OpenZeppelin, worked on user management, and finally on a linear bonding curve for setting a price for buying and selling a token. I got to know the Remix Dev Environemnt, all browser based. At the end of the week I added test case to debug. A very cool feature is Solidity debugging, which helped me a lot. 
worked with Remix and Solidity testing. 

--- Week two: ERC 721 ---
