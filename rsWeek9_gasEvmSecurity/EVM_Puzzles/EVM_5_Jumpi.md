The fifth Puzzle introduces DUP1, MUL, PUSH, EQ are self explanatory. Jumpi was new because it needs 2 arguments, first the jump address and second the condition.
In this case EQ must give 1. To make this true the value must be equal to 0x100, which equals 256. The square root of 256 is 16, which makes 16 our imput and solution.
