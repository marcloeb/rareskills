Your Question:
safeTransferFrom and transferFrom. What are the differences between these two functions? Create a markdown file describing their differences

Definition from the openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol source file:
Interface for any contract that wants to support safeTransfers from ERC721 asset contracts.

My answer:
safeTransferFrom checks if the receiver implements the IERC721Receiver interface. If yes, the transfer happens, if no, the transfer does not happen. This check is only for contracts.
transferFrom does not make this check, so a contract without an implementation of the IERC721Receiver interface can receive a nft.
