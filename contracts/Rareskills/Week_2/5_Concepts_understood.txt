Understand the ERC721 protocol completely
● Did work with OpenZeppelin

Put an NFT collection on OpenSea and understand the idiosyncrasies of integrating with OpenSea
● Did work with Polygon and Görli. Biggest issue was time needed to see file on IPFS and connecting my 
  Metamask wallet with OpenSea to see the minted NFTs

Understand IPFS and why NFTs use them
● Watched the vids, not went into details

 Verifying smart contracts on Ethers-can
● Done on Görli and Mumbai Polygon

nonsequential ids
● NFTs have no sequencial ids, understood.

staking
Task 2 was all about this, I think I understood.

stopping smart contracts from minting
● _beforeTokenTransfer add a require statment

● provenance hashes
With the provenance hash, NFT projects can prove to the community 
that the NFT images and metadata were pre-determined beforehand, 
without having to expose their metadata before launch!

Not clear:

Royalties -> When trades take place, eg 5% goes to the creator AAM do not support it
● What do we need the openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Royalty.sol?

OpenSea Gas Free Exchange
https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500006315941-What-are-gas-fees-
--> some actions need gas

metadata leaks
● when do they happen???? I assume this happens when collector see what
is minted through metadata and adapt their buying behavior 
-> therefore provenance hashes.

● ERC721A on https://www.erc721a.org with gas optimization up to 50%
not used but checked. Can we use it instead of OpenZeppelin?

burning tokens
● problems with the provenance hashes?
